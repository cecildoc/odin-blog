    <p>Why does music exist?How does music exist? A philosopher, 
        will say to express humanities feelings, 
        or perhaps to worship some god through our collective voice. 
        Voice can indeed be music. Even if out of tune, the voice is undoubtedly music. 
        I can’t say that I know how to sing correctly, but that has never stopped me. 
        I’m quite sure it has never stopped anyone from singing. Singing. To sing. What is to sing, 
        but to express what we feel through the instrument that we always carry with us?  </p>

    <p>
        Continuing on the thematic of musical instruments, 
        I highly recommend everyone, regardless of age, to buy an instrument.
         Find something you think you will enjoy. 
         An acoustic guitar, a harmonica, a recorder. 
         Even a piano for the more affluent of you. Give it a try. 
         There are countless instruments out in the world. 
         I am quite certain I can name a couple that you’ve never heard of. 
         Although that’s not what I am here to do. 
         Personally, I’ve played the guitar for over a decade, 
         focusing mostly on a playstyle called fingerstyle.
          For example Tommy Emmanuel, one of the greatest, if not the greatest, 
          fingerstyle guitarist. </p>
          
          <p>But I haven’t limited myself to the guitar.
           Oh no dear reader. That would be a sin. Do some introspection. 
           Don’t you enjoy the sound of a piano playing Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata? 
           Well so do I. I am only human after all. But let me ask again, 
           don’t you also enjoy the simple, earthly sounds of a classical guitar strumming to the tune of “Hey there Delilah”? 
           So why should you limit yourself to one instrument? 
           If your answer is that you shouldn’t then go ahead. Explore. 
           Have a childlike curiosity to discover. 
           As for myself, during those hard times, in the year 2020, 
           I’ve learnt to play a few simple songs on the piano. 
           Why shouldn’t you do that? If one can, all can.
            There is nothing stopping you but yourself. Try out something, give it a month.
             Then do some introspection and answer to yourself, 
             truthfully if you’ve hated or liked it. 
        Then go ahead and try something new. Why shouldn’t you after all? </p>
