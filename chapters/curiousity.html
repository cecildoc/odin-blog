    What is? What is what? You will definitely notice that all of the chapters will 
    begin with a question. What. But what is what? One could say that what, 
    is the innate curiosity of humankind. But you may ask, what is this curiosity? 
    To that I say isn’t that but the essence of being? Consider this, 
    if you willingly accept whatever others say, can you claim that you are living for 
    yourself? If you are spoon fed all the information you believe you need to know, 
    can you actually claim that you know? What is to know? 
    I believe that it is the essence of living. Knowing, learning, acknowledging.

        Children are the paragons of curiosity. We’ve all been there before. The never ending 
        questions of a child that has just learnt to talk and walk. 
        “ What’s that mommy?” “ Oh but that’s an apple dear.”. That is what curiosity is.
        An insatiable need to know. Why can’t I understand Mandarin? 
        Why are apples red? Why is the sky blue? Can you, dear reader, answer all of
        these questions? I cannot. But I want to. Why can’t I understand Mandarin? 
        Aren’t languages just sounds that we make? Why can I understand one sound 
        but not the other? Why can I understand the word amalgamation but not the
        word ネコ( Neko). Why does the sound NE-KO make no sense? We use the sound
        NE, in NEgative , and the KO sound in COmmoner. So why doesn’t the sound
        NEKO make sense? That is curiosity. My example isn’t the most well thought, 
        or accurate, but the point remains. Curiosity is asking questions.
        Why, what, how, when? Who invented the mouse? Who invented typography.
        Why did Gutenberg invent that printing press. What did he want to achieve?
        What were his thoughts?
