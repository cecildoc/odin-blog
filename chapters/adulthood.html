    <p> As usual, I will preface with the question: What? What does it mean to be an 
        “adult”? What does it mean to be mature? What does “adulthood” entail? </p>

    <p>We have to realize that the notion of adulthood and political rights is not 
        a modern notion. For example, in the ancient city state of Athens,
        adolescents called “epheboi” would enroll for military training, and
        only after finishing that training would they be eligible to participate 
        in the city-states politics. That is when they became adults
        During Feudal Europe the majority of people worked from the moment 
        they were able to walk and pick up tools. From drawing water, to tilling the fields. </p>
    <p>
        People were undeniably more mature when comparing 
        today's 16 year olds to 15th century 16 year olds. 
        Which by no means is a bad thing. 
        In reality it just shows how peaceful and prosperous our age has been. 
        Nevertheless, what does it mean to be an adult? What are our responsibilities? 
        What are our rights? No one can name all of them. 
        Which is weird when you think about it. You live in a country, whether that 
        country is Canada, the USA or India. You have rights and responsibilities 
        towards the country you reside in. But you’ll notice that while the state 
        makes sure you “remember” your responsibilities,
        no one, and I literally mean no one, will remind you of your rights.
